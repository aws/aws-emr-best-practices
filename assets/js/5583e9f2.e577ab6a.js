If you see unexpected results, then check your Spark UI and see if you are getting too many task failures from a single node by sorting the Task list based on "Status" and check for error message of failed tasks. If you are seeing too many random unexpected errors such as "ArrayIndexOutOfBounds" or checksum errors from a single node, then it may be possible that the node is impaired.
